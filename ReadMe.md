# About

App for reading CO2 ppm from MH-Z19 sensor and saving to a local csv file. 

## Credits

This project is based on the original [MH-Z19 UART app](https://github.com/skotopes/flipperzero_mhz19_uart) by [Aku](https://github.com/skotopes). Enhanced with CSV logging functionality for data collection and analysis.

# Pinout

Flipper | Sensor
--------|-------
1       | 5V
8       | GND
15      | RX
16      | TX


# CSV Logging

The app automatically creates a CSV file at `/ext/apps_data/co2_logger/co2_log.csv` on the SD card and logs valid CO2 readings at the configured interval with the following format:

```
Timestamp,CO2_PPM
2024-01-15 14:30:25,420
2024-01-15 14:30:55,425
```

The CSV file includes:
- Timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format
- CO2 concentration in PPM

**Data Quality Features:**
- Configurable logging intervals: 15s, 30s, or 60s (default: 30s)

# Features

- **Auto-Dim Control**: Toggle the automatic screen dimming functionality in settings. When disabled, the screen will stay bright during use.
- **Configurable Logging**: Set logging intervals of 15s, 30s, or 60s to match your monitoring needs.
- **CSV Logging Toggle**: Enable or disable CSV file logging in settings. When enabled, CO2 readings are saved to the SD card.

# TO DO

There are a few features that I am hoping to add, if you can make any contributions I would greatly appreciate it.
- Make a website that can detect if the Flipper is connected via USB, read the CSV file, and display a line chart. I have built a prototype with Loveable that can detect and connect to the Flipper's CLI, but I'm having issues reading the CSV from the Flipper Zero.
